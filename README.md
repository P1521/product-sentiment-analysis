Analyzing Customer Reviews using NLP approach
The web has made it possible for organizations to discover what customers are saying about their brands online, either in mainstream media like online newspapers and magazines, or on social media. 

Consumers now search for opinions online before, during, and after a purchase. The next step for brands is finding out whether people are talking positively or negatively about their brand, and why. 

Some online ratings provide a number but not the reasoning behind it, and may only present half of the story. The process of analyzing a user's opinion or sentiment about particular services or products and their features is called opinion mining or sentiment analysis.
